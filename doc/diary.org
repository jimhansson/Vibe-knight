- Project started. This project will be developed primarily with the assistance of AI tools and automation.
*** 2025-05-16
- Improved test and build system: exported test symbols, added src to ASDF registry, and updated Makefile for reliable test runs.
- Added and refactored wave function collapse algorithm for biomes in world.lisp, including support for weighted biomes and flexible neighborhood functions.
- Added unit tests for neighbors-4 and neighbors-8 using the Prove framework, and created a Makefile test target.
- Fixed issues with package visibility and local system loading for both build and test workflows.
- Committed and pushed all changes to version control.
*** 2025-05-17
  - Refactored and significantly generalized the wave function collapse (WFC) logic:
  - Moved all WFC-related code to a new file (`src/wfc.lisp`), making it a standalone, reusable module.
  - Made the WFC API fully generic: no more biome-specific logic; all constraint logic is user-supplied.
  - Added general neighbor functions: `neighbors-4` and `neighbors-8` for flexible adjacency.
  - Allowed user-supplied collapse and propagation functions via `:collapse-fn` and `:propagate-fn`.
  - Added support for hooks: `:on-collapse`, `:on-propagate`, and `:on-contradiction` for extensibility and debugging.
