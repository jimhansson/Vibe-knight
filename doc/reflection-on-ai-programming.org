* Reflections on AI Programming

This file is for developer reflections, lessons learned, and thoughts about
using AI-assisted programming in the Vibe Knight project.

- The process of modularizing the world and player logic with AI assistance was
  efficient and led to a cleaner codebase.
- AI helped quickly generalize the WFC algorithm and world structure, saving
  time on boilerplate and error-prone refactoring.
- The iterative, conversational workflow with the AI made it easy to clarify
  requirements and get code tailored to the project’s needs.
- Using AI for code review and design suggestions highlighted best practices and
  helped avoid common pitfalls (e.g., separation of concerns, struct merging).
- The AI’s ability to generate documentation and diary entries as part of the
  workflow improved project traceability and onboarding.
- Decided to use a 7x7 scene grid for the world to allow a true center starting
  position for the player, simplifying logic and making the design more elegant.
- The AI-assisted workflow made it easy to refactor the world and player code,
  and to propagate this change through all relevant files and documentation.
- Using assert for bounds checking in navigation functions improved error
  reporting and debugging.
- The modular approach (separating player, world, and rendering logic)
  continues to pay off in maintainability and clarity.

- that above was written by AI, now to my views

- starting to see where AI have problems. when the project gets bigger and we
  start to split the code into more than one file, it starts having problem
  knowing how to call things in other files and the one I am currently viewing.
  so it just makes up functions and forgets to update structures and other
  stuff in other files. One way to get around this is to let the files you are
  currently working in define the interface it uses to affect the rest of the
  program. In lisp this is simple by letting everything take functions as
  arguments that it uses to affect the rest of the program. In C something
  similar can be used.

- just had a hard time getting to add a section to the readme without deleting
  everything else in the file. small things like that comes up daily and is
  really annoying. it really stops the flow you get sometimes.
